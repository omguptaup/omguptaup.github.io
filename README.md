## Portfolio Website

This website provides my curriculum vitae in a fun but professional-looking format. It also allows visitors to contact me through email, as well as follow me on social media (if they wish to).

The folders are labelled corresponding to the data they contain, and so are the css and html files.

The website has been mostly created with the help of Grapedrop (https://grapedrop.com/) by visually copying a template from Wix (https://www.wix.com/). The code from Grapedrop has been exported free-of-charge using my web-dev skills.

The contact form operates using the Formspree API. Check out https://formspree.io/ for free backend support on HTML forms.
